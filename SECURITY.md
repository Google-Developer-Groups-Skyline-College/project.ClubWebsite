# Security Policy

This document concerns our club's general security policy.

## 🛠️ Project-Specific Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| All Current Builds (excludes Legacy) | :white_check_mark: |

We currently rely on Dependabot and CodeQL on our repositories to monitor for new potential vulnerabilities in all pushes. 

We of course, however, need to account for cases that fly past that first automated line of defense.

## 🔐 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know right away.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly resolve any and all problems.

To contact us, email `skylinecompsciclub@gmail.com` to disclose said potential vulnerabilities.

Urgent? Please contact us privately via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/z5P9kccwRh) to raise a more immediate resolution.
